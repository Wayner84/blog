# Vee Blocks, Resin Suction Forces and Logging

## What I worked on

- First prototype of **vee blocks**
- A rough-and-ready **resin peel / suction force estimator** for MSLA prints (mainly to explore the idea of support generation that considers *forces*, not just geometry)

---

## What’s the goal?

I’ve had issues getting a completely perpendicular face on the surface that faces the bed on my Saturn 3 Ultra.

- The opposing face is perfect and flat within **50 microns** (measuring 24 points on a CMM)
- The vee itself measures **90.0018°** — basically perfect
- But the bottom face shows scarring and issues with warping

This was using the auto support generation in Elegoo SatelLite.

Since then I ran a second trial where I rotated the part **20° in Rx** and **7° in Ry**, again with auto supports, to see whether orientation helps with the large cross‑sectional suction forces.

Because it’s solid, it’s hard to minimise suction area completely — a big chunk of the model is always going to be “doing work” each layer.

Unfortunately the second run warped badly and even had a slight layer shift. Past the layer shift the print came out perfect, which (to me) points to **insufficient support** earlier on.

## Next steps

Auto supports can be great, but they aren’t as mature as the FDM world where support generation has had loads of time + open-source iteration.

For the next test I’m going to go **manual supports**, even if it’s a pain — and I’ll live with that while I think about something more permanent.

---

## Suction forces (the side quest)

This started as a shower thought: simulate the suction forces a printer experiences across layers/regions, with the long-term goal of building an open-source support generator that considers **layer forces**, not just geometry.

I messaged Clawdbot to quickly put together something that could estimate suction forces for a given STL. I didn’t do a ton of research up front (so I didn’t exactly give it the perfect brief), but it still produced a decent “per-layer” force model.

I still need to:

- properly review the code
- understand the Stefan model end-to-end
- figure out how to incorporate the FEP’s behaviour (no vat tilting on my setup)

![Photo: suction force output / sim screenshot (placeholder for now)](../assets/images/placeholder.svg)

The output looks OK, but it needs to become something that *actually helps* support generation.
Right now it mostly tells me what I already know (even though it’s useful to have it quantified).

This is something I want to keep working on for large-scale manufacturing reliability — but the immediate focus is still a perfect vee block I can sell.

---

## Why I’m logging all this

I do a lot of random (sometimes useful) work. I want to get better at sharing what I learn — and keeping a central place I can point people to.

Either way: thanks for the read.
