# Vee Block Clamp Tests

I’ve been doing a few **thread tests**, and it turns out it’s surprisingly hard to get a thread that’s *both* printable and actually functional (good engagement, correct fit, and not a pain to assemble).

For the **vee block clamp** itself I need a bit of flexibility (unlike the vee block body), so I’m moving this part to the **FDM printer in ABS**.

I’d normally consider PLA because it’s easy, but PLA has a huge problem with **creep over time**. These clamps won’t see crazy forces, but if I’m holding a part for a few hours a day on a CMM, PLA will slowly relax. So: **ABS it is**.

That leaves the big question:

- What do I do about the **threads** on the clamp?
- Do I use **brass heat inserts**?
- Do I **tap** directly into the FDM print?

It’s a lot of decisions for what should be a simple threaded part.

To get some real answers, I ordered:

- **M6 brass heat inserts** from AliExpress (ridiculously cheap)
- A **tap and die set (M2–M12)** (also cheap, but honestly the quality looks great for the price)

The goal with these purchases is simple: figure out what’s actually going to work for the final product.

## Test 1: tapping directly into FDM ABS

I printed a set of simple blocks to test the “just tap the plastic” approach.

Print settings / notes:

- **3 wall perimeters** to give enough material for the thread to cut into
- Followed the *Zeus* book **tapping drill sizes** for **M3, M4, M6, M8**
- I was modelling in a hurry (half watching a film) and **forgot to chamfer** the holes… which definitely didn’t help for starting the taps

Six sample parts took **just under an hour** to print.

Results:

- **M8, M6, and M4** tapped completely fine
- They were a bit finicky to start (a chamfer would have helped a lot)
- **M3** started cutting, but the fine pitch ended up pulling plastic out and it wouldn’t properly bite

Next steps for the M3:

- First I’ll re-print with a **proper chamfer**
- If it still behaves badly, I’ll try **increasing the tapping drill size** slightly

Realistically, for FDM I’m probably going to stick to **M4 and above** anyway — the pitch gets so small at M3 that stripping becomes way too easy.

---

## Test 2: clamp prototypes — heat insert vs tapped hole

Now that I know tapping into ABS is at least viable, the next test is to print some clamps for the **35 mm² vee blocks**.

I’m going to print two clamp samples:

1) One with an **M6 heat insert**
2) One with a **5 mm hole** for **tapping M6** directly

Both will be **solid infill** for these tests.

For now I’ll use a simple bolt for clamping, because it’s high quality and strong enough to not be a variable.

Once I’ve decided the direction, I’ll figure out the final plan for the **threaded shaft / clamping screw** part.

---

## The threaded shaft problem (and a possible shortcut)

I did a quick preliminary test on making printed “studs” and cutting the thread using a die:

- One shaft at **11.87 mm** for **M12**
- One shaft at **7.97 mm** for **M8**

A quick Google gave me those diameters for die-cutting, but they’re likely intended for metal.

Both shafts **split at the layer line**, which is not surprising given they were printed vertically.

What I’m going to try next:

- Print horizontally (or at least not purely vertical)
- Go slightly more undersized
- Try resin as well — although I expect it to be **too brittle**

If printed shafts keep being unreliable, the “boring but strong” approach is probably best:

- Use a **headed bolt** as the shaft
- Add a **knurled/hand knob** at the top for easy turning

That does add some cost, but it might be worth it for reliability.
A quick AliExpress search looks like about **75p for 10**, so it’s not outrageous.

The aim here is to choose whatever gives the most consistent, durable clamp — even if it’s not the purest “fully printed” solution.
